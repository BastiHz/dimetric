Goals of this project:
* Learn about [dimetric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_video_game_graphics#Dimetric_projection)
* Make some pixel art
* Learn type hinting and mypy: I did this and learned that it's not very useful for a pygame project.

This will either result in a game or the template for a game.
